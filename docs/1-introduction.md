# 1. Introduction

## 1.1. The Problem with the Classical Approach

In traditional approaches to organizing information, strategies, and systems, a **waterfall model** is often used, which has numerous limitations:

-   **Lack of unification and systematization** – each part of the strategy or system is created independently, leading to inconsistencies.
-   **Difficulties in iterative improvement** – modifying one element often requires a complete overhaul of the entire structure.
-   **Lack of flexibility** – the absence of precisely defined connections between elements makes it difficult to track changes.
-   **Problematic implementation of changes** – every update requires resynchronization of all related elements, generating additional work.

## 1.2. What is the Theory of Componentization (ToC)?

The **Theory of Componentization (ToC)** is a **modular approach** to organizing information, processes, and systems. Its goal is to **structure thinking by breaking down complex structures into smaller units** that can be easily modified, iterated upon, and combined into larger entities.

The main elements of ToC are:

-   **Components** – basic units containing information.
-   **Modules** – groups of related components.
-   **Models** – complete structures that combine modules into a whole.
-   **Frames** – metadata sets for each element.
-   **Connectors** – mechanisms defining the flow of information.
-   **Versioning** – tracking changes at every element level.

ToC helps organize complex systems, eliminating informational chaos and ensuring dynamic iteration in business strategy, IT, and management.

## 1.3. How Does ToC Solve the Problem?

The Theory of Componentization introduces a **new way of thinking** based on:

### 1.3.1. A Structural Approach

-   **Dividing into components, modules, and models** ensures that each element is clearly defined and can be modified independently.
-   **A hierarchical structure** allows for precise management of the system without requiring a complete overhaul.

### 1.3.2. Simplified Iteration and Versioning

-   **Each element has a version**, making it easier to track changes and implement new solutions.
-   **Changing one component** does not force changes in the entire system – everything depends on the hierarchy level.

### 1.3.3. Transparency and Control of Information Flow

-   **Input and output connectors** define where an element retrieves data and where it sends it.
-   **Frames ensure** that every part of the system has a clearly defined context and relationships with other elements.

## 1.4. Summary

The Theory of Componentization (ToC) represents **a fundamental shift in the way information is organized and managed**. It enables the creation of **more flexible, scalable, and iterative systems** that better adapt to changes.
